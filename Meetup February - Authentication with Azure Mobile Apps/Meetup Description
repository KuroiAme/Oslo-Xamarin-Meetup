What better way then starting the new year getting together for a hands-on Workshop with your favorite Xamarin crew!

Let's create a "My new years resolution" app for keeping track of our 2019 goals and our progress through the year. Learning multiple subjects such as Azure Mobile Apps, Offline data Sync, user authentication, storage, visualization, layout, sharing, Push notifications, CI/CD with AppCenter and more.

This workshop is the second meetup in a series of workshops completing our app, taking you from Beginner to more Advanced topics. This time focusing on Authenticating users with Azure Mobile Apps.

Azure Mobile Apps use a variety of external identity providers to support authenticating and authorizing application users, including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Azure Active Directory.
