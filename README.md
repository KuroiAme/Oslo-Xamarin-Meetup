# Oslo Xamarin Meetup

**Location: Teknologihuset, Pilestredet 56, Oslo**  
**Organizers: Monica B. Tvedt, Kristoffer Hove**

Interested in Xamarin and/or cross platform mobile development in C#? 
Whether just starting or an experienced developer, youâ€™re welcome! 

Xamarin enables developers to create native iOS, Android, Mac and Windows apps in C#. 
We will be talking about topics like the Xamarin Platform, Xamarin.Forms, 
Xamarin Insights, Azure, and Visual Studio App Center among others. 

We meet monthly at **Teknologihuset**, in Oslo. Come along and listen to talks and connect with others in the community. 
We look forward to seeing you there!

Upcoming Meetups can be found at [Meetup.com / Oslo Xamarin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-Xamarin-Meetup/), and
all Meetup slide decks and code will be published here at GitHub after each gathering.


Best regards,  
Oslo Xamarin Meetup
